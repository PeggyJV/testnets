# Systemd

The following are example systemd unit files to help you manage the variety of services we are running to support the network. Systemd unit files live in `/etc/systemd/system/` and any changes in that folder require a restart of the the systemd process to take effect: `sudo systemctl daemon-reload`

> NOTE: These files are all written for the `ubuntu` user. The user on your system may be different as well as having different `ExecStart` locations. Make sure the files are customized for your environment!!!
